[> Milkymist Software Platform
------------------------------


[> Instructions
---------------
1. Follow software instructions from milkymist-ng.
   libbase must be built.

2. Download source code of external libs and set environment variables
   to the root of each source distribution, as follows:
     M2DIR          milkymist-ng      http://milkymist.org
     LUADIR         Lua (5.2.0)       http://lua.org
     YAFFSDIR       YAFFS             http://yaffs.net
     FTDIR          Freetype (2.4.9)  http://freetype.org
   The CRTDIR environment variable is still needed (and is the only one
   which should not point to the root of the source distribution, but to
   where the .a binary is located)

3. Type make to compile everything (including libraries).

4. Run the generated misp.bin.
